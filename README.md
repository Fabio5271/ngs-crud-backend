# ngs-crud-backend
Back-end of my user/role management web application
Built with Spring Boot 3 and MongoDB

# Requirements:
Java JDK (17 or newer)
Spring Tools (on any IDE)
MongoDB Database
MongoDB Compass (optional, for interacting with the DB via GUI)

# How to run the back-end:
Clone the repo
Ensure the MongoDB service is running
Open the project in your IDE
Run the project

You'll then be able to test this back-end by making HTTP requests to localhost:8081/api/user and localhost:8081/api/role or run the full application with the front-end app at https://github.com/Fabio5271/ngs-crud-frontend
